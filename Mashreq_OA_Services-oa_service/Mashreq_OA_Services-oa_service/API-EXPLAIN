        + "AND pmt.PYMT_REQ_ID = " + pymtReqId;
Explanation:

Tables Involved:

oa_payment_requests: Alias pmt is used for this table.
oa_suppliers: Alias sp is used for this table.
oa_agreement_details: Alias agr is used for this table.
Selected Columns:

The query selects various columns from the tables, including PYMT_REQ_ID, MATRIX_FILE_REF_NO, MATRIX_REF_NO, INVOICE_AMOUNT, SUPPLIER_ID, BUDGET_YEAR, SERVICE_CODE, MGMT_COMP_ID, BUILDING_ID, PAYMENT_TYPE, BIFURCATION, TRADE_LICENSE_EXP_DATE, AUTO_RENEWAL, IS_GOVERNMENT_ENTITY, IS_INSURANCE_COMPANY, AGREEMENT_EXP_DATE.
Joins:

The query uses multiple joins to connect the tables based on specific conditions:
pmt.SUPPLIER_ID = sp.SUPPLIER_ID: Joining oa_payment_requests with oa_suppliers.
pmt.MGMT_COMP_ID = agr.MGMT_COMP_ID: Joining oa_payment_requests with oa_agreement_details based on management company ID.
pmt.SUPPLIER_ID = agr.SUPPLIER_ID: Further joining based on supplier ID.
PMT.BUILDING_ID = agr.BUILDING_ID: Additional condition based on building ID.
WHERE Clause:

The WHERE clause filters the result set based on the value of PYMT_REQ_ID.
Aliases:

Aliases (pmt, sp, agr) are used to simplify the SQL query by providing shorthand names for the table names.
